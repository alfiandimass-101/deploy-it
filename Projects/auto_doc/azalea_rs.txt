Crate azalea Copy item path Source Expand description Azalea is a framework for creating Minecraft bots. This page is primarily meant for developers that already know they want to use Azalea. See the readme for a higher-level overview of Azalea. § Installation First, install Rust nightly with rustup install nightly and rustup default nightly . Then, use one of the following commands to add Azalea to your project: Latest bleeding-edge version (recommended): cargo add azalea --git=https://github.com/azalea-rs/azalea Latest “stable” release: cargo add azalea § Optimization For faster compile times, create a .cargo/config.toml file in your project and copy this file into it. You may have to install the LLD linker. For faster performance in debug mode, add the following code to your Cargo.toml: [profile.dev] opt-level = 1 [profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3 § Documentation The documentation for the latest Azalea crates.io release is available at docs.rs/azalea and the docs for the latest bleeding-edge (git) version are at azalea.matdoes.dev . § Examples //! A bot that logs chat messages and the number that we've received to the console. use std::sync::Arc; use azalea::prelude:: * ; use parking_lot::Mutex; #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread" )] async fn main() { let account = Account::offline( "bot" ); // or Account::microsoft("example@example.com").await.unwrap(); ClientBuilder::new() .set_handler(handle) .start(account, "localhost" ) . await .unwrap(); } #[derive(Default, Clone, Component)] pub struct State { /// An example field that stores the number of messages that've been /// received by the client so far. The state gets cloned whenever the /// handler is called, so to have all the clones point to the same data and /// have it be mutable, we use an Arc<Mutex<T>>. pub messages_received: Arc<Mutex<usize>> } async fn handle(bot: Client, event: Event, state: State) -> anyhow::Result<()> { match event { Event::Chat(m) => { let mut messages_received = state.messages_received.lock(); * messages_received += 1 ; println! ( "#{messages_received}: {}" , m.message().to_ansi()); // messages_received gets implicitly unlocked here because it's dropped } _ => {} } Ok (()) } There are more examples in the examples directory . You may also find it helpful to read the code for other people’s Azalea bots . § Swarms Azalea lets you create “swarms”, which are a group of bots in the same world that can perform actions together. See testbot for an example. Also, if you’re using swarms, you should also use both azalea::prelude::* and azalea::swarm::prelude::* . § Plugins Azalea uses Bevy ECS internally to store information about the world and clients. Bevy plugins are more powerful than async handler functions, but more difficult to use. See pathfinder as an example of how to make a plugin. You can then enable a plugin by adding .add_plugin(ExamplePlugin) in your client/swarm builder. Everything in Azalea is implemented as a Bevy plugin, which means you can disable default behaviors (like, physics or chat signing) by disabling built-in plugins. See SwarmBuilder::new_without_plugins to learn how to do that. Also note that just because something is an entity in the ECS doesn’t mean that it’s a Minecraft entity. You can filter for that by having With<MinecraftEntityId> as a filter. See the Bevy Cheatbook to learn more about Bevy ECS (and the ECS paradigm in general). § Using a single-threaded Tokio runtime Due to the fact that Azalea clients store the ECS in a Mutex that’s frequently locked and unlocked, bots that rely on the Client or Swarm types may run into race condition bugs (like out-of-order events and ticks happening at suboptimal moments) if they do not set Tokio to use a single thread with #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")] . This may change in a future version of Azalea. Setting this option will usually not result in a performance hit, and Azalea internally will keep using multiple threads for running the ECS itself (because Tokio is not used for this). § Debugging Azalea uses several relatively complex features of Rust, which may make debugging certain issues more tricky if you’re not familiar with them. § Logging One of the most useful tools for debugging issues is logging. The default log level is info , but you can make it show more or less information by changing the log level. Enabling logging is done with RUST_LOG=debug cargo run on Linux/bash or set RUST_LOG=debug && cargo run on Windows. The log levels are trace , debug , info , warn , and error , in ascending priority. If it’s a crash/panic and you believe it has to do with parsing a packet, you might want to set the level to trace since that’ll make it show the first few hundred bytes of every packet received. This may produce a lot of logs, so use a command like RUST_LOG=trace NO_COLOR=1 cargo run &> azalea.log to nicely pipe it into a file (on Linux). Note: If you get a SetLoggerError , it’s because you have multiple loggers. Azalea comes with a logger by default, see bevy_log for more information. You can disable the default logging plugin by disabling the log feature. § Deadlocks If your code is simply hanging, it might be a deadlock. Enable parking_lot ’s deadlock_detection feature and copy the deadlock block in azalea/examples/testbot.rs to the beginning of your code and it’ll print a long backtrace if a deadlock is detected. § Backtraces Backtraces are also useful, though they’re sometimes hard to read and don’t always contain the actual location of the error. Run your code with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 to enable full backtraces. If it’s very long, often searching for the keyword “azalea” will help you filter out unrelated things and find the actual source of the issue.

Structs § Account Something that can join Minecraft servers. Block Pos The coordinates of a block in the world. Client A Minecraft client instance that can interact with the world. Client Builder A builder for creating new Client s. This is the recommended way of making Azalea bots.

InGame State A marker component for local players that are currently in the game state. Join Opts Optional settings when adding an account to a swarm or client. Joined Client Bundle A bundle for the components that are present on a local player that is currently in the game protocol state. If you want to filter for this, use InGameState . Local Player Bundle A bundle of components that’s inserted right when we switch to the login state and stay present on our clients until we disconnect. NoState A marker that can be used in place of a State in ClientBuilder or SwarmBuilder . You probably don’t need to use this manually since the compiler will infer it for you. Physics State Component for entities that can move and sprint. Usually only in LocalEntity s. Resource Location Start Client Opts Start Sprint Event An event sent when the client starts sprinting. This does not get sent for non-local entities. Start Walk Event An event sent when the client starts walking. This does not get sent for non-local entities. Vec3 Used to represent an exact position in the world where an entity could be. Enums § Account Opts The parameters that were passed for creating the associated Account . Event Something that happened in-game, such as a tick passing or chat message being sent. Formatted Text A chat component, basically anything you can see in chat. Join Error An error that happened while joining the server. Sprint Direction The directions that a player can sprint in. It’s a subset of WalkDirection . Start Error An error related to resolving the server address when starting a client. Walk Direction A direction that a player can walk in, including none.

azalea :: swarm Struct Swarm Builder Copy item path Source pub struct SwarmBuilder<S, SS, R, SR> where S: Send + Sync + Clone + Component + 'static, SS: Default + Send + Sync + Clone + Resource + 'static, Self: Send , { /* private fields */ } Expand description Create a new Swarm . The generics of this struct stand for the following: S: State SS: Swarm State R: Return type of the handler SR: Return type of the swarm handler You shouldn’t have to manually set them though, they’ll be inferred for you. Implementations § Source § impl SwarmBuilder < NoState , NoSwarmState , () , () > Source pub fn new () -> Self Start creating the swarm. Source pub fn new_without_plugins () -> Self Self::new but without adding the plugins by default. This is useful if you want to disable a default plugin. This also exists for ClientBuilder , see ClientBuilder::new_without_plugins . You must add DefaultPlugins , DefaultBotPlugins , and DefaultSwarmPlugins to this. use azalea::app::PluginGroup; let swarm_builder = SwarmBuilder::new_without_plugins() .add_plugins(azalea::DefaultPlugins.build().disable::<azalea::chat_signing::ChatSigningPlugin>()) .add_plugins(azalea::bot::DefaultBotPlugins) .add_plugins(azalea::swarm::DefaultSwarmPlugins); Source § impl<SS, SR> SwarmBuilder < NoState , SS, () , SR> where SS: Default + Send + Sync + Clone + Resource + 'static, Source pub fn set_handler <S, Fut, R>( self, handler: HandleFn <S, Fut>, ) -> SwarmBuilder <S, SS, R, SR> where Fut: Future <Output = R> + Send + 'static, S: Send + Sync + Clone + Component + Default + 'static, Set the function that’s called every time a bot receives an Event . This is the way to handle normal per-bot events. Currently you can have up to one handler. Note that if you’re creating clients directly from the ECS using StartJoinServerEvent and the client wasn’t already in the ECS, then the handler function won’t be called for that client. This also applies to SwarmBuilder::set_swarm_handler . This shouldn’t be a concern for most bots, though. swarm_builder.set_handler(handle); #[derive(Component, Default, Clone)] struct State {} async fn handle( mut bot: Client, event: Event, state: State) -> anyhow::Result<()> { Ok (()) } Source § impl<S, R> SwarmBuilder <S, NoSwarmState , R, () > where S: Send + Sync + Clone + Component + 'static, Source pub fn set_swarm_handler <SS, Fut, SR>( self, handler: SwarmHandleFn <SS, Fut>, ) -> SwarmBuilder <S, SS, R, SR> where SS: Default + Send + Sync + Clone + Resource + 'static, Fut: Future <Output = SR> + Send + 'static, Set the function that’s called every time the swarm receives a SwarmEvent . This is the way to handle global swarm events. Currently you can have up to one swarm handler. Note that if you’re creating clients directly from the ECS using StartJoinServerEvent and the client wasn’t already in the ECS, then this handler function won’t be called for that client. This also applies to SwarmBuilder::set_handler .

Use Self::add_account to only add one account. If you want the clients to have different default states, add them one at a time with Self::add_account_with_state . By default, every account will join at the same time, you can add a delay with Self::join_delay . Source pub fn add_account (self, account: Account ) -> Self where S: Default , Add a single new Account to the swarm. Use Self::add_accounts to add multiple accounts at a time. This will make the state for this client be the default, use Self::add_account_with_state to avoid that. Source pub fn add_account_with_state (self, account: Account , state: S) -> Self Add an account with a custom initial state. Use just Self::add_account to use the Default implementation for the state. Source pub fn add_account_with_opts (self, account: Account , opts: JoinOpts ) -> Self where S: Default , Add an account with a custom initial state. Use just Self::add_account to use the Default implementation for the state. Source pub fn add_account_with_state_and_opts ( self, account: Account , state: S, join_opts: JoinOpts , ) -> Self Same as Self::add_account_with_state , but allow passing in custom join options. Source pub fn set_swarm_state (self, swarm_state: SS) -> Self Set the swarm state instead of initializing defaults. Source pub fn add_plugins <M>(self, plugins: impl Plugins <M>) -> Self Add one or more plugins to this swarm. See Self::new_without_plugins to learn how to disable default plugins. Source pub fn join_delay (self, delay: Duration ) -> Self Set how long we should wait between each bot joining the server. By default, every bot will connect at the same time. If you set this field, however, the bots will wait for the previous one to have connected and then they’ll wait the given duration. Source pub fn reconnect_after (self, delay: impl Into < Option < Duration >>) -> Self Configures the auto-reconnection behavior for our bots. If this is Some , then it’ll set the default reconnection delay for our bots (how long they’ll wait after being kicked before they try rejoining). if it’s None , then auto-reconnecting will be disabled. If this function isn’t called, then our clients will reconnect after DEFAULT_RECONNECT_DELAY . Source pub async fn start ( self, address: impl TryInto < ServerAddress >, ) -> Result < AppExit , StartError > Build this SwarmBuilder into an actual Swarm and join the given server. The address argument can be a &str , ServerAddress , or anything that implements TryInto<ServerAddress> . Source pub async fn start_with_default_opts ( self, address: impl TryInto < ServerAddress >, default_join_opts: JoinOpts , ) -> Result < AppExit , StartError > Do the same as Self::start , but allow passing in default join options for the bots.

azalea Crate bevy_ tasks Copy item path Source Expand description § Bevy Tasks A refreshingly simple task executor for bevy. :) This is a simple threadpool with minimal dependencies. The main usecase is a scoped fork-join, i.e. spawning tasks from a single thread and having that thread await the completion of those tasks. This is intended specifically for bevy as a lighter alternative to rayon for this specific usecase. There are also utilities for generating the tasks from a slice of data. This library is intended for games and makes no attempt to ensure fairness or ordering of spawned tasks. It is based on async-executor , a lightweight executor that allows the end user to manage their own threads. async-executor is based on async-task, a core piece of async-std. § Usage In order to be able to optimize task execution in multi-threaded environments, bevy provides three different thread pools via which tasks of different kinds can be spawned. (The same API is used in single-threaded environments, even if execution is limited to a single thread. This currently applies to Wasm targets.) The determining factor for what kind of work should go in each pool is latency requirements: For CPU-intensive work (tasks that generally spin until completion) we have a standard ComputeTaskPool and an AsyncComputeTaskPool . Work that does not need to be completed to present the next frame should go to the AsyncComputeTaskPool . For IO-intensive work (tasks that spend very little time in a “woken” state) we have an IoTaskPool whose tasks are expected to complete very quickly. Generally speaking, they should just await receiving data from somewhere (i.e. disk) and signal other systems when the data is ready for consumption. (likely via channels) § no_std Support To enable no_std support in this crate, you will need to disable default features, and enable the edge_executor and critical-section features. Modules § futures Utilities for working with Future s. futures_ lite Futures, streams, and async I/O combinators. prelude The tasks prelude. Structs § Async Compute Task Pool A newtype for a task pool for CPU-intensive work that may span across multiple frames Compute Task Pool A newtype for a task pool for CPU-intensive work that must be completed to deliver the next frame IoTask Pool A newtype for a task pool for IO-intensive work (i.e. tasks that spend very little time in a “woken” state) Scope A TaskPool scope for running one or more non- 'static futures. Task Wraps async_executor::Task , a spawned future. Task Pool A thread pool for executing tasks. Task Pool Builder Used to create a TaskPool Thread Executor An executor that can only be ticked on the thread it was instantiated on. But can spawn Send tasks from other threads. Thread Executor Ticker Used to tick the ThreadExecutor . The executor does not make progress unless it is manually ticked on the thread it was created on. Traits § Conditional Send Use ConditionalSend to mark an optional Send trait bound. Useful as on certain platforms (eg. Wasm), futures aren’t Send. Conditional Send Future Use ConditionalSendFuture for a future with an optional Send trait bound, as on certain platforms (eg. Wasm), futures aren’t Send. Parallel Iterator ParallelIterator closely emulates the std::iter::Iterator interface. However, it uses bevy_task to compute batches in parallel. Parallel Slice Provides functions for mapping read-only slices across a provided TaskPool . Parallel Slice Mut Provides functions for mapping mutable slices across a provided TaskPool . Functions § available_ parallelism Gets the logical CPU core count available to the current process. block_ on Blocks the current thread on a future. poll_ once Polls a future just once and returns an Option with the result. tick_ global_ task_ pools_ on_ main_ thread A function used by bevy_app to tick the global tasks pools on the main thread. This will run a maximum of 100 local tasks per executor per call to this function. Type Aliases § Boxed Future An owned and dynamically typed Future used when you can’t statically type your result or need to add some indirection.

azalea Enum Event Copy item path Source #[non_exhaustive] pub enum Event { Show 13 variants Init, Login, Spawn, Chat( ChatPacket ), Tick, Packet( Arc < ClientboundGamePacket >), AddPlayer( PlayerInfo ), RemovePlayer( PlayerInfo ), UpdatePlayer( PlayerInfo ), Death( Option < Arc < ClientboundPlayerCombatKill >>), KeepAlive( u64 ), Disconnect( Option < FormattedText >), ReceiveChunk( ChunkPos ), } Expand description Something that happened in-game, such as a tick passing or chat message being sent. Note: Events are sent before they’re processed, so for example game ticks happen at the beginning of a tick before anything has happened. Variants (Non-exhaustive) § This enum is marked as non-exhaustive Non-exhaustive enums could have additional variants added in future. Therefore, when matching against variants of non-exhaustive enums, an extra wildcard arm must be added to account for any future variants. § Init Happens right after the bot switches into the Game state, but before it’s actually spawned. This can be useful for setting the client information with Client::set_client_information , so the packet doesn’t have to be sent twice. You may want to use Event::Spawn instead to wait for the bot to be in the world. § Login Fired when we receive a login packet, which is after Event::Init but before Event::Spawn . You usually want Event::Spawn instead. Your position may be Vec3::ZERO immediately after you receive this event, but it’ll be ready by the time you get Event::Spawn . It’s possible for this event to be sent multiple times per client if a server sends multiple login packets (like when switching worlds). § Spawn Fired when the player fully spawns into the world (is in a loaded chunk) and is ready to interact with it. This is usually the event you should listen for when waiting for the bot to be ready. This event will be sent every time the client respawns or switches worlds, as long as the server sends chunks to the client. § Chat( ChatPacket ) A chat message was sent in the game chat. § Tick Happens 20 times per second, but only when the world is loaded. § Packet( Arc < ClientboundGamePacket >) We received a packet from the server. Event::Packet(packet) => match * packet { ClientboundGamePacket::Login( _ ) => { println! ( "login packet" ); } _ => {} }, § AddPlayer( PlayerInfo ) A player joined the game (or more specifically, was added to the tab list). § RemovePlayer( PlayerInfo ) A player left the game (or maybe is still in the game and was just removed from the tab list). § UpdatePlayer( PlayerInfo ) A player was updated in the tab list (gamemode, display name, or latency changed). § Death( Option < Arc < ClientboundPlayerCombatKill >>) The client player died in-game. § KeepAlive( u64 ) A KeepAlive packet was sent by the server. § Disconnect( Option < FormattedText >) The client disconnected from the server. § ReceiveChunk( ChunkPos ) Trait Implementations § Source § impl Clone for Event Source § fn clone (&self) -> Event Returns a duplicate of the value.

To join a server using this account, use Client::join or azalea::ClientBuilder . This is also an ECS component that is present on our client entities. § Examples let account = Account::microsoft( "example@example.com" ). await ; // or Account::offline("example"); Fields § § username: String The Minecraft username of the account. § access_token: Option < Arc < Mutex < RawMutex , String >>> The access token for authentication. You can obtain one of these manually from azalea-auth. This is an Arc<Mutex> so it can be modified by Self::refresh . § uuid: Option < Uuid > Only required for online-mode accounts. § account_opts: AccountOpts The parameters (i.e. email) that were passed for creating this Account . This is used for automatic reauthentication when we get “Invalid Session” errors. If you don’t need that feature (like in offline mode), then you can set this to AuthOpts::default() . § certs: Arc < Mutex < RawMutex , Option < Certificates >>> The certificates used for chat signing. This is set when you call Self::request_certs , but you only need to if the servers you’re joining require it. Implementations § Source § impl Account Source pub fn offline (username: & str ) -> Account An offline account does not authenticate with Microsoft’s servers, and as such can only join offline mode servers. This is useful for testing in LAN worlds.

Source pub async fn refresh (&self) -> Result < () , AuthError > Refresh the access_token for this account to be valid again. This requires the auth_opts field to be set correctly (which is done by default if you used the constructor functions). Note that if the Account is offline-mode then this function won’t do anything. Source pub fn uuid_or_offline (&self) -> Uuid Get the UUID of this account. This will generate an offline-mode UUID by making a hash with the username if the uuid field is None.

azalea Struct Client Copy item path Source pub struct Client { pub entity: Entity , pub ecs: Arc < Mutex < RawMutex , World >>, } Expand description A Minecraft client instance that can interact with the world. To make a new client, use either azalea::ClientBuilder or Client::join . Note that Client is inaccessible from systems (i.e. plugins), but you can achieve everything that client can do with ECS events. Fields § § entity: Entity The entity for this client in the ECS. § ecs: Arc < Mutex < RawMutex , World >> The entity component system. You probably don’t need to access this directly. Note that if you’re using a shared world (i.e. a swarm), this will contain all entities in all worlds. Implementations § Source § impl Client Source pub fn new (entity: Entity , ecs: Arc < Mutex < RawMutex , World >>) -> Client Create a new client from the given GameProfile , ECS Entity, ECS World, and schedule runner function. You should only use this if you want to change these fields from the defaults, otherwise use Client::join . Source pub async fn join ( account: Account , address: impl TryInto < ServerAddress >, ) -> Result <( Client , UnboundedReceiver < Event >), JoinError > Connect to a Minecraft server. To change the render distance and other settings, use Client::set_client_information . To watch for events like packets sent by the server, use the rx variable this function returns. § Examples use azalea_client::{Account, Client}; #[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread" )] async fn main() -> Result <(), Box< dyn std::error::Error>> { let account = Account::offline( "bot" ); let (client, rx) = Client::join(account, "localhost" ). await ? ; client.chat( "Hello, world!" ); client.disconnect(); Ok (()) } Source pub async fn join_with_proxy ( account: Account , address: impl TryInto < ServerAddress >, proxy: Proxy , ) -> Result <( Client , UnboundedReceiver < Event >), JoinError > Source pub async fn start_client (__arg0: StartClientOpts ) -> Client Create a Client when you already have the ECS made with [ start_ecs_runner ]. You’d usually want to use Self::join instead. Source pub fn write_packet (&self, packet: impl Packet < ServerboundGamePacket >) Write a packet directly to the server. Source pub fn disconnect (&self) Disconnect this client from the server by ending all tasks. The OwnedReadHalf for the TCP connection is in one of the tasks, so it automatically closes the connection when that’s dropped. Source pub fn raw_connection <'a>(&'a self, ecs: &'a mut World ) -> &'a RawConnection Source pub fn raw_connection_mut <'a>( &'a self, ecs: &'a mut World , ) -> Mut <'a, RawConnection > Source pub fn component <T>(&self) -> T where T: Component + Clone , Get a component from this client. This will clone the component and return it. If the component can’t be cloned, try Self::map_component instead. If it isn’t guaranteed to be present, use Self::get_component or Self::map_get_component . You may also use Self::ecs and Self::query directly if you need more control over when the ECS is locked. § Panics This will panic if the component doesn’t exist on the client. § Examples let world_name = client.component::<InstanceName>(); Source pub fn get_component <T>(&self) -> Option <T> where T: Component + Clone , Get a component from this client, or None if it doesn’t exist. If the component can’t be cloned, try Self::map_component instead. You may also have to use Self::ecs and Self::query directly. Source pub fn resource <T>(&self) -> T where T: Resource + Clone , Get a resource from the ECS. This will clone the resource and return it. Source pub fn map_resource <T, R>(&self, f: impl FnOnce ( &T ) -> R) -> R where T: Resource , Get a required ECS resource and call the given function with it. Source pub fn map_get_resource <T, R>(&self, f: impl FnOnce ( Option < &T >) -> R) -> R where T: Resource , Get an optional ECS resource and call the given function with it. Source pub fn map_component <T, R>(&self, f: impl FnOnce ( &T ) -> R) -> R where T: Component , Get a required component for this client and call the given function. Similar to Self::component , but doesn’t clone the component since it’s passed as a reference. Self::ecs will remain locked while the callback is being run. If the component is not guaranteed to be present, use Self::get_component instead. § Panics This will panic if the component doesn’t exist on the client. let hunger = bot.map_component::<Hunger, _ >(|h| h.food); Source pub fn map_get_component <T, R>(&self, f: impl FnOnce ( &T ) -> R) -> Option <R> where T: Component , Optionally get a component for this client and call the given function. Similar to Self::get_component , but doesn’t clone the component since it’s passed as a reference. Self::ecs will remain locked while the callback is being run. Source pub fn world (&self) -> Arc < RwLock < RawRwLock , Instance >> Get an RwLock with a reference to our (potentially shared) world. This gets the Instance from the client’s InstanceHolder component. If it’s a normal client, then it’ll be the same as the world the client has loaded. If the client is using a shared world, then the shared world will be a superset of the client’s world. Source pub fn partial_world (&self) -> Arc < RwLock < RawRwLock , PartialInstance >> Get an RwLock with a reference to the world that this client has loaded. let world = client.partial_world(); let is_0_0_loaded = world.read().chunks.limited_get( & ChunkPos::new( 0 , 0 )).is_some(); Source pub fn logged_in (&self) -> bool Returns whether we have a received the login packet yet. Source § impl Client Source pub fn position (&self) -> Vec3 Get the position of this client. This is a shortcut for Vec3::from(&bot.component::<Position>()) . Note that this value is given a default of Vec3::ZERO when it receives the login packet, its true position may be set ticks later. Source pub fn dimensions (&self) -> EntityDimensions Get the bounding box dimensions for our client, which contains our width, height, and eye height. This is a shortcut for self.component::<EntityDimensions>() . Source pub fn eye_position (&self) -> Vec3 Get the position of this client’s eyes. This is a shortcut for bot.position().up(bot.dimensions().eye_height) . Source pub fn health (&self) -> f32 Get the health of this client. This is a shortcut for *bot.component::<Health>() . Source pub fn hunger (&self) -> Hunger Get the hunger level of this client, which includes both food and saturation. This is a shortcut for self.component::<Hunger>().to_owned() . Source pub fn username (&self) -> String Get the username of this client. This is a shortcut for bot.component::<GameProfileComponent>().name.to_owned() . Source pub fn uuid (&self) -> Uuid Get the Minecraft UUID of this client. This is a shortcut for bot.component::<GameProfileComponent>().uuid . Source pub fn tab_list (&self) -> HashMap < Uuid , PlayerInfo > Get a map of player UUIDs to their information in the tab list. This is a shortcut for *bot.component::<TabList>() . Source pub fn profile (&self) -> GameProfile Returns the GameProfile for our client. This contains your username, UUID, and skin data. These values are set by the server upon login, which means they might not match up with your actual game profile. Also, note that the username and skin that gets displayed in-game will actually be the ones from the tab list, which you can get from Self::tab_list . This as also available from the ECS as GameProfileComponent . Source pub fn player_uuid_by_username (&self, username: & str ) -> Option < Uuid > A convenience function to get the Minecraft Uuid of a player by their username, if they’re present in the tab list. You can chain this with Client::entity_by_uuid to get the ECS Entity for the player. Source pub fn entity_by_uuid (&self, uuid: Uuid ) -> Option < Entity > Get an ECS Entity in the world by its Minecraft UUID, if it’s within render distance. Source pub fn minecraft_entity_by_ecs_entity ( &self, entity: Entity , ) -> Option < MinecraftEntityId > Convert an ECS Entity to a MinecraftEntityId . Source pub fn ecs_entity_by_minecraft_entity ( &self, entity: MinecraftEntityId , ) -> Option < Entity > Convert a MinecraftEntityId to an ECS Entity . Source pub fn with_registry_holder <R>(&self, f: impl FnOnce (& RegistryHolder ) -> R) -> R Call the given function with the client’s RegistryHolder . The player’s instance (aka world) will be locked during this time, which may result in a deadlock if you try to access the instance again while in the function. Source pub fn resolve_registry_name ( &self, registry: &impl ResolvableDataRegistry , ) -> Option < ResourceLocation > Resolve the given registry to its name. This is necessary for data-driven registries like Enchantment . Source pub fn with_resolved_registry <R>( &self, registry: impl ResolvableDataRegistry , f: impl FnOnce (& ResourceLocation , & NbtCompound ) -> R, ) -> Option <R> Resolve the given registry to its name and data and call the given function with it. This is necessary for data-driven registries like Enchantment . If you just want the value name, use Self::resolve_registry_name instead. Source § impl Client Source pub fn query <'w, D>(&self, ecs: &'w mut World ) -> <D as QueryData >:: Item <'w> where D: QueryData , A convenience function for getting components of our player’s entity. § Examples let is_logged_in = client .query::< Option < & InstanceName>>( &mut client.ecs.lock()) .is_some(); Source pub fn any_entity_by <F, Q>( &self, predicate: impl EntityPredicate<Q, F>, ) -> Option < Entity > where F: QueryFilter , Q: QueryData , Quickly returns a lightweight Entity for an arbitrary entity that matches the given predicate function that is in the same Instance as the client. You can then use Self::entity_component to get components from this entity. If you want to find the nearest entity, consider using Self::nearest_entity_by instead. If you want to find all entities that match the predicate, use Self::nearest_entities_by . § Example use azalea_client::{Client, player::GameProfileComponent}; use azalea_entity::{Position, metadata::Player}; use bevy_ecs::query::With; let entity = bot.any_entity_by::<With<Player>, ( & GameProfileComponent,)>( |(profile,): & ( & GameProfileComponent,)| profile.name == sender_name, ); if let Some (entity) = entity { let position = bot.entity_component::<Position>(entity); // ... } Source pub fn nearest_entity_by <F, Q>( &self, predicate: impl EntityPredicate<Q, F>, ) -> Option < Entity > where F: QueryFilter , Q: QueryData , Return a lightweight Entity for the nearest entity that matches the given predicate function. You can then use Self::entity_component to get components from this entity. If you don’t need the entity to be the nearest one, it may be more efficient to use Self::any_entity_by instead. You can also use Self::nearest_entities_by to get all nearby entities. use azalea_entity::{LocalEntity, Position, metadata::Player}; use bevy_ecs::query::{With, Without}; // get the position of the nearest player if let Some (nearest_player) = bot.nearest_entity_by::<(With<Player>, Without<LocalEntity>), ()>(| _ : & ()| true ) { let nearest_player_pos = * bot.entity_component::<Position>(nearest_player); bot.chat( format! ( "You are at {nearest_player_pos}" )); } Source pub fn nearest_entities_by <F, Q>( &self, predicate: impl EntityPredicate<Q, F>, ) -> Vec < Entity > where F: QueryFilter , Q: QueryData , Similar to Self::nearest_entity_by but returns a Vec<Entity> of all entities in our instance that match the predicate. The first entity is the nearest one. let nearby_players = bot.nearest_entities_by::<(With<Player>, Without<LocalEntity>), ()>(| _ : & ()| true ); Source pub fn entity_component <Q>(&self, entity: Entity ) -> Q where Q: Component + Clone , Get a component from an entity. Note that this will return an owned type (i.e. not a reference) so it may be expensive for larger types. If you’re trying to get a component for this client, use Self::component . Source pub fn get_entity_component <Q>(&self, entity: Entity ) -> Option <Q> where Q: Component + Clone , Get a component from an entity, if it exists. This is similar to Self::entity_component but returns an Option instead of panicking if the component isn’t present. Source § impl Client Source pub fn attack (&self, entity: Entity ) Attack the entity with the given id. Source pub fn has_attack_cooldown (&self) -> bool Whether the player has an attack cooldown. Also see Client::attack_cooldown_remaining_ticks . Source pub fn attack_cooldown_remaining_ticks (&self) -> usize Returns the number of ticks until we can attack at full strength again. Also see Client::has_attack_cooldown . Source § impl Client Source pub fn write_chat_packet (&self, message: & str ) Send a chat message to the server. This only sends the chat packet and not the command packet, which means on some servers you can use this to send chat messages that start with a / . The Client::chat function handles checking whether the message is a command and using the proper packet for you, so you should use that instead. Source pub fn write_command_packet (&self, command: & str ) Send a command packet to the server. The command argument should not include the slash at the front. You can also just use Client::chat and start your message with a / to send a command. Source pub fn chat (&self, content: impl Into < String >) Send a message in chat. bot.chat( "Hello, world!" ); Source § impl Client Source pub async fn set_client_information ( &self, client_information: ClientInformation , ) Tell the server we changed our game options (i.e. render distance, main hand). If this is not set before the login packet, the default will be sent. bot.set_client_information(ClientInformation { view_distance: 2 , ..Default::default() }) . await ; Source § impl Client Source pub fn block_interact (&self, position: BlockPos ) Right-click a block. The behavior of this depends on the target block, and it’ll either place the block you’re holding in your hand or use the block you clicked (like toggling a lever). Note that this may trigger anticheats as it doesn’t take into account whether you’re actually looking at the block. Source pub fn start_use_item (&self) Right-click the currently held item. If the item is consumable, then it’ll act as if right-click was held until the item finishes being consumed. You can use this to eat food. If we’re looking at a block or entity, then it will be clicked. Also see Client::block_interact . Source § impl Client Source pub fn menu (&self) -> Menu Return the menu that is currently open. If no menu is open, this will have the player’s inventory. Source pub fn selected_hotbar_slot (&self) -> u8 Returns the index of the hotbar slot that’s currently selected. If you want to access the actual held item, you can get the current menu with Client::menu and then get the slot index by offsetting from the start of azalea_inventory::Menu::hotbar_slots_range . You can use Self::set_selected_hotbar_slot to change it. Source pub fn set_selected_hotbar_slot (&self, new_hotbar_slot_index: u8 ) Update the selected hotbar slot index. This will run next Update , so you might want to call bot.wait_updates(1) after calling this if you’re using azalea . Source § impl Client Source pub fn start_mining (&self, position: BlockPos ) Source pub fn left_click_mine (&self, enabled: bool ) When enabled, the bot will mine any block that it is looking at if it is reachable. Source § impl Client Source pub fn set_jumping (&self, jumping: bool ) Set whether we’re jumping. This acts as if you held space in vanilla. If you want to jump once, use the jump function. If you’re making a realistic client, calling this function every tick is recommended. Source pub fn jumping (&self) -> bool Returns whether the player will try to jump next tick. Source pub fn set_crouching (&self, crouching: bool ) Source pub fn crouching (&self) -> bool Whether the client is currently trying to sneak. You may want to check the Pose instead. Source pub fn set_direction (&self, y_rot: f32 , x_rot: f32 ) Sets the direction the client is looking. y_rot is yaw (looking to the side), x_rot is pitch (looking up and down). You can get these numbers from the vanilla f3 screen. y_rot goes from -180 to 180, and x_rot goes from -90 to 90. Source pub fn direction (&self) -> ( f32 , f32 ) Returns the direction the client is looking. The first value is the y rotation (ie. yaw, looking to the side) and the second value is the x rotation (ie. pitch, looking up and down). Source § impl Client Source pub fn walk (&self, direction: WalkDirection ) Start walking in the given direction. To sprint, use Client::sprint . To stop walking, call walk with WalkDirection::None . § Examples Walk for 1 second bot.walk(WalkDirection::Forward); tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs( 1 )). await ; bot.walk(WalkDirection::None); Source pub fn sprint (&self, direction: SprintDirection ) Start sprinting in the given direction. To stop moving, call bot.walk(WalkDirection::None) § Examples Sprint for 1 second bot.sprint(SprintDirection::Forward); tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs( 1 )). await ; bot.walk(WalkDirection::None); Trait Implementations § Source § impl AutoToolClientExt for Client Source § fn best_tool_in_hotbar_for_block (&self, block: BlockState ) -> BestToolResult Source § async fn mine_with_auto_tool (&self, block_pos: BlockPos ) Source § impl BotClientExt for Client Source § fn get_tick_broadcaster (&self) -> Receiver < () > Returns a Receiver that receives a message every game tick. This is useful if you want to efficiently loop until a certain condition is met. let mut ticks = bot.get_tick_broadcaster(); while ticks.recv(). await .is_ok() { let ecs = bot.ecs.lock(); if ecs.get::<WaitingForInventoryOpen>(bot.entity).is_none() { break ; } } Source § fn get_update_broadcaster (&self) -> Receiver < () > Returns a Receiver that receives a message every ECS Update. ECS Updates happen at least at the frequency of game ticks, usually faster. This is useful if you’re sending an ECS event and want to make sure it’s been handled before continuing. Source § async fn wait_ticks (&self, n: usize ) Wait for the specified number of ticks using Self::get_tick_broadcaster . If you’re going to run this in a loop, you may want to use that function instead and use the Receiver from it to avoid accidentally skipping ticks and having to wait longer. Source § async fn wait_updates (&self, n: usize ) Waits for the specified number of ECS Update s using Self::get_update_broadcaster . These are basically equivalent to frames because even though we have no rendering, some game mechanics depend on frames. If you’re going to run this in a loop, you may want to use that function instead and use the Receiver from it to avoid accidentally skipping ticks and having to wait longer. Source § fn jump (&self) Queue a jump for the next tick. Source § fn look_at (&self, position: Vec3 ) Turn the bot’s head to look at the coordinate in the world. Source § async fn mine (&self, position: BlockPos ) Mine a block. This won’t turn the bot’s head towards the block, so if that’s necessary you’ll have to do that yourself with look_at .

This is the recommended way of making Azalea bots. ClientBuilder::new() .set_handler(handle) .start(Account::offline( "bot" ), "localhost" ) . await ; Implementations § Source § impl ClientBuilder < NoState , () > Source pub fn new () -> Self Start building a client that can join the world. Source pub fn new_without_plugins () -> Self Self::new but without adding the plugins by default. This is useful if you want to disable a default plugin. This also exists for swarms, see SwarmBuilder::new_without_plugins . Note that you can also disable LogPlugin by disabling the log feature. You must add DefaultPlugins and DefaultBotPlugins to this. use azalea::app::PluginGroup; let client_builder = ClientBuilder::new_without_plugins() .add_plugins( azalea::DefaultPlugins .build() .disable::<azalea::chat_signing::ChatSigningPlugin>(), ) .add_plugins(azalea::bot::DefaultBotPlugins); Source pub fn set_handler <S, Fut, R>( self, handler: HandleFn <S, Fut>, ) -> ClientBuilder <S, R> where S: Default + Send + Sync + Clone + Component + 'static, Fut: Future <Output = R> + Send + 'static, R: Send + 'static, Set the function that’s called every time a bot receives an Event . This is the way to handle normal per-bot events. Currently, you can have up to one client handler. Note that if you’re creating clients directly from the ECS using StartJoinServerEvent and the client wasn’t already in the ECS, then the handler function won’t be called for that client. This shouldn’t be a concern for most bots, though. client_builder.set_handler(handle); async fn handle( mut bot: Client, event: Event, state: State) -> anyhow::Result<()> { Ok (()) } Source § impl<S, R> ClientBuilder <S, R> where S: Default + Send + Sync + Clone + Component + 'static, R: Send + 'static, Source pub fn set_state (self, state: S) -> Self Set the client state instead of initializing defaults.

Source pub fn reconnect_after (self, delay: impl Into < Option < Duration >>) -> Self Configures the auto-reconnection behavior for our bot. If this is Some , then it’ll set the default reconnection delay for our bot (how long it’ll wait after being kicked before it tries rejoining). if it’s None , then auto-reconnecting will be disabled. If this function isn’t called, then our client will reconnect after DEFAULT_RECONNECT_DELAY . Source pub async fn start ( self, account: Account , address: impl TryInto < ServerAddress >, ) -> Result < AppExit , StartError > Build this ClientBuilder into an actual Client and join the given server. If the client can’t join, it’ll keep retrying forever until it can. The address argument can be a &str , ServerAddress , or anything that implements TryInto<ServerAddress> . § Errors This will error if the given address is invalid or couldn’t be resolved to a Minecraft server. Source pub async fn start_with_opts ( self, account: Account , address: impl TryInto < ServerAddress >, opts: JoinOpts , ) -> Result < AppExit , StartError > Do the same as Self::start , but allow passing in custom join options.

Usually only in LocalEntity s. Fields § § position_remainder: u32 Minecraft only sends a movement packet either after 20 ticks or if the player moved enough. This is that tick counter. § was_sprinting: bool § trying_to_sprint: bool § trying_to_crouch: bool Whether our player is currently trying to sneak. This is distinct from AbstractEntityShiftKeyDown , which is a metadata value that is controlled by the server and affects how the nametags of other entities are displayed.

Variants § § Text( TextComponent ) § Translatable( TranslatableComponent ) Implementations § Source § impl FormattedText A chat component Source pub fn get_base_mut (&mut self) -> &mut BaseComponent Source pub fn get_base (&self) -> & BaseComponent Source pub fn to_custom_format <F, S, C>( &self, style_formatter: F, text_formatter: S, cleanup_formatter: C, default_style: & Style , ) -> String where F: FnMut (& Style , & Style ) -> ( String , String ), S: FnMut (& str ) -> String , C: FnMut (& Style ) -> String , Render all components into a single String , using your custom closures to drive styling, text transformation, and final cleanup. § Type params F : (running, component, default) -> (prefix, suffix) for per-component styling S : &str -> String for text tweaks (escaping, mapping, etc.) C : &final_running_style -> String for any trailing cleanup § Args style_formatter : how to open/close each component’s style text_formatter : how to turn raw text into output text cleanup_formatter : emit after all components (e.g. reset codes) default_style : where to reset when a component’s reset is true § Example use azalea_chat::{FormattedText, DEFAULT_STYLE}; use serde::de::Deserialize; let component = FormattedText::deserialize( & serde_json::json! ({ "text" : "Hello, world!" , "color" : "red" , })).unwrap(); let ansi = component.to_custom_format( |running, new| (running.compare_ansi(new), "" .to_string()), |text| text.to_string(), |style| { if !style.is_empty() { "\u{1b}[m" .to_string() } else { "" .to_string() } }, & DEFAULT_STYLE, ); println!

This is the same as FormattedText::to_ansi , but you can specify a default Style to use. Source pub fn to_ansi (&self) -> String Convert this component into an ANSI string , so you can print it to your terminal and get styling. This is technically a shortcut for FormattedText::to_ansi_with_custom_style with a default Style colored white.

Read more Source § impl Default for AcceptResourcePacksPlugin Source § fn default () -> AcceptResourcePacksPlugin Returns the “default value” for a type. Read more Source § impl Plugin for AcceptResourcePacksPlugin Source § fn build (&self, app: &mut App ) Configures the App to which this plugin is added. Source § fn ready (&self, _app: & App ) -> bool Has the plugin finished its setup? This can be useful for plugins that need something asynchronous to happen before they can finish their setup, like the initialization of a renderer. Once the plugin is ready, finish should be called. Source § fn finish (&self, _app: &mut App ) Finish adding this plugin to the App , once all plugins registered are ready. This can be useful for plugins that depends on another plugin asynchronous setup, like the renderer. Source § fn cleanup (&self, _app: &mut App ) Runs after all plugins are built and finished, but before the app schedule is executed. This can be useful if you have some resource that other plugins need during their build step, but after build you want to remove it and send it to another thread. Source § fn name (&self) -> & str Configures a name for the Plugin which is primarily used for checking plugin uniqueness and debugging. Source § fn is_unique (&self) -> bool If the plugin can be meaningfully instantiated several times in an App , override this method to return false .

azalea :: attack Struct Attack Plugin Copy item path Source pub struct AttackPlugin; Trait Implementations § Source § impl Plugin for AttackPlugin Source § fn build (&self, app: &mut App ) Configures the App to which this plugin is added. Source § fn ready (&self, _app: & App ) -> bool Has the plugin finished its setup? This can be useful for plugins that need something asynchronous to happen before they can finish their setup, like the initialization of a renderer. Once the plugin is ready, finish should be called. Source § fn finish (&self, _app: &mut App ) Finish adding this plugin to the App , once all plugins registered are ready. This can be useful for plugins that depends on another plugin asynchronous setup, like the renderer. Source § fn cleanup (&self, _app: &mut App ) Runs after all plugins are built and finished, but before the app schedule is executed. This can be useful if you have some resource that other plugins need during their build step, but after build you want to remove it and send it to another thread. Source § fn name (&self) -> & str Configures a name for the Plugin which is primarily used for checking plugin uniqueness and debugging.

Unlike the standard partial comparison between floating point numbers, this comparison always produces an ordering in accordance to the totalOrder predicate as defined in the IEEE 754 (2008 revision) floating point standard. The values are ordered in the following sequence: negative quiet NaN negative signaling NaN negative infinity negative numbers negative subnormal numbers negative zero positive zero positive subnormal numbers positive numbers positive infinity positive signaling NaN positive quiet NaN. The ordering established by this function does not always agree with the PartialOrd and PartialEq implementations of f32 . For example, they consider negative and positive zero equal, while total_cmp doesn’t. The interpretation of the signaling NaN bit follows the definition in the IEEE 754 standard, which may not match the interpretation by some of the older, non-conformant (e.g. MIPS) hardware implementations. § Example struct GoodBoy { name: String, weight: f32, } let mut bois = vec!

azalea :: auto_reconnect Struct Auto Reconnect Delay Copy item path Source pub struct AutoReconnectDelay { pub delay: Duration , } Expand description A resource and component that indicates how long to wait before reconnecting when we’re kicked. Initially, it’s a resource in the ECS set to 5 seconds. You can modify the resource to update the global reconnect delay, or insert it as a component to set the individual delay for a single client. You can also remove this resource from the ECS to disable the default auto-reconnecting behavior. Inserting the resource/component again will not make clients that were already disconnected automatically reconnect.

azalea :: auto_reconnect Struct Auto Reconnect Plugin Copy item path Source pub struct AutoReconnectPlugin; Expand description A default plugin that makes clients automatically rejoin the server when they’re disconnected. The reconnect delay is configurable globally or per-client with the AutoReconnectDelay resource/component. Auto reconnecting can be disabled by removing the resource from the ECS. The delay defaults to DEFAULT_RECONNECT_DELAY . Trait Implementations § Source § impl Plugin for AutoReconnectPlugin Source § fn build (&self, app: &mut App ) Configures the App to which this plugin is added. Source § fn ready (&self, _app: & App ) -> bool Has the plugin finished its setup? This can be useful for plugins that need something asynchronous to happen before they can finish their setup, like the initialization of a renderer. Once the plugin is ready, finish should be called. Source § fn finish (&self, _app: &mut App ) Finish adding this plugin to the App , once all plugins registered are ready. This can be useful for plugins that depends on another plugin asynchronous setup, like the renderer. Source § fn cleanup (&self, _app: &mut App ) Runs after all plugins are built and finished, but before the app schedule is executed. This can be useful if you have some resource that other plugins need during their build step, but after build you want to remove it and send it to another thread. Source § fn name (&self) -> & str Configures a name for the Plugin which is primarily used for checking plugin uniqueness and debugging. Source § fn is_unique (&self) -> bool If the plugin can be meaningfully instantiated several times in an App , override this method to return false .

This can be useful for plugins that depends on another plugin asynchronous setup, like the renderer. Source § fn cleanup (&self, _app: &mut App ) Runs after all plugins are built and finished, but before the app schedule is executed. This can be useful if you have some resource that other plugins need during their build step, but after build you want to remove it and send it to another thread.

azalea :: bevy_tasks Struct Async Compute Task Pool Copy item path Source pub struct AsyncComputeTaskPool( /* private fields */ ); Expand description A newtype for a task pool for CPU-intensive work that may span across multiple frames See TaskPool documentation for details on Bevy tasks. Use ComputeTaskPool if the work must be complete before advancing to the next frame. Implementations § Source § impl AsyncComputeTaskPool Source pub fn get_or_init ( f: impl FnOnce () -> TaskPool , ) -> &'static AsyncComputeTaskPool Gets the global AsyncComputeTaskPool instance, or initializes it with f . Source pub fn try_get () -> Option <&'static AsyncComputeTaskPool > Attempts to get the global AsyncComputeTaskPool instance, or returns None if it is not initialized. Source pub fn get () -> &'static AsyncComputeTaskPool Gets the global AsyncComputeTaskPool instance. § Panics Panics if the global instance has not been initialized yet. Methods from Deref <Target = TaskPool > § Source pub fn thread_num (&self) -> usize Return the number of threads owned by the task pool Source pub fn scope <'env, F, T>(&self, f: F) -> Vec <T> where F: for<'scope> FnOnce (&'scope Scope <'scope, 'env, T>), T: Send + 'static, Allows spawning non- 'static futures on the thread pool. The function takes a callback, passing a scope object into it. The scope object provided to the callback can be used to spawn tasks. This function will await the completion of all tasks before returning. This is similar to thread::scope and rayon::scope . § Example use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; let pool = TaskPool::new(); let mut x = 0 ; let results = pool.scope(|s| { s.spawn( async { // you can borrow the spawner inside a task and spawn tasks from within the task s.spawn( async { // borrow x and mutate it. x = 2 ; // return a value from the task 1 }); // return some other value from the first task 0 }); }); // The ordering of results is non-deterministic if you spawn from within tasks as above. // If you're doing this, you'll have to write your code to not depend on the ordering. assert! (results.contains( & 0 )); assert! (results.contains( & 1 )); // The ordering is deterministic if you only spawn directly from the closure function. let results = pool.scope(|s| { s.spawn( async { 0 }); s.spawn( async { 1 }); }); assert_eq! ( & results[..], & [ 0 , 1 ]); // You can access x after scope runs, since it was only temporarily borrowed in the scope. assert_eq! (x, 2 ); § Lifetimes The Scope object takes two lifetimes: 'scope and 'env . The 'scope lifetime represents the lifetime of the scope. That is the time during which the provided closure and tasks that are spawned into the scope are run. The 'env lifetime represents the lifetime of whatever is borrowed by the scope. Thus this lifetime must outlive 'scope . ⓘ use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; fn scope_escapes_closure() { let pool = TaskPool::new(); let foo = Box::new( 42 ); pool.scope(|scope| { std::thread::spawn( move || { // UB. This could spawn on the scope after `.scope` returns and the internal Scope is dropped. scope.spawn( async move { assert_eq! ( * foo, 42 ); }); }); }); } ⓘ use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; fn cannot_borrow_from_closure() { let pool = TaskPool::new(); pool.scope(|scope| { let x = 1 ; let y = & x; scope.spawn( async move { assert_eq! ( * y, 1 ); }); }); } Source pub fn scope_with_executor <'env, F, T>( &self, tick_task_pool_executor: bool , external_executor: Option <& ThreadExecutor <'_>>, f: F, ) -> Vec <T> where F: for<'scope> FnOnce (&'scope Scope <'scope, 'env, T>), T: Send + 'static, This allows passing an external executor to spawn tasks on. When you pass an external executor Scope::spawn_on_scope spawns is then run on the thread that ThreadExecutor is being ticked on. If None is passed the scope will use a ThreadExecutor that is ticked on the current thread. When tick_task_pool_executor is set to true , the multithreaded task stealing executor is ticked on the scope thread. Disabling this can be useful when finishing the scope is latency sensitive. Pulling tasks from global executor can run tasks unrelated to the scope and delay when the scope returns. See Self::scope for more details in general about how scopes work. Source pub fn spawn <T>( &self, future: impl Future <Output = T> + Send + 'static, ) -> Task <T> ⓘ where T: Send + 'static, Spawns a static future onto the thread pool. The returned Task is a future that can be polled for the result. It can also be canceled and “detached”, allowing the task to continue running even if dropped. In any case, the pool will execute the task even without polling by the end-user. If the provided future is non- Send , TaskPool::spawn_local should be used instead. Source pub fn spawn_local <T>( &self, future: impl Future <Output = T> + 'static, ) -> Task <T> ⓘ where T: 'static, Spawns a static future on the thread-local async executor for the current thread. The task will run entirely on the thread the task was spawned on. The returned Task is a future that can be polled for the result. It can also be canceled and “detached”, allowing the task to continue running even if dropped. In any case, the pool will execute the task even without polling by the end-user. Users should generally prefer to use TaskPool::spawn instead, unless the provided future is not Send . Source pub fn with_local_executor <F, R>(&self, f: F) -> R where F: FnOnce (&LocalExecutor<'_>) -> R, Runs a function with the local executor. Typically used to tick the local executor on the main thread as it needs to share time with other things. use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; TaskPool::new().with_local_executor(|local_executor| { local_executor.try_tick(); }); Trait Implementations § Source § impl Debug for AsyncComputeTaskPool Source § fn fmt (&self, f: &mut Formatter <'_>) -> Result < () , Error > Formats the value using the given formatter.

Thus this lifetime must outlive 'scope . ⓘ use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; fn scope_escapes_closure() { let pool = TaskPool::new(); let foo = Box::new( 42 ); pool.scope(|scope| { std::thread::spawn( move || { // UB.

When you pass an external executor Scope::spawn_on_scope spawns is then run on the thread that ThreadExecutor is being ticked on. If None is passed the scope will use a ThreadExecutor that is ticked on the current thread. When tick_task_pool_executor is set to true , the multithreaded task stealing executor is ticked on the scope thread. Disabling this can be useful when finishing the scope is latency sensitive. Pulling tasks from global executor can run tasks unrelated to the scope and delay when the scope returns. See Self::scope for more details in general about how scopes work.

azalea :: bevy_tasks Struct IoTask Pool Copy item path Source pub struct IoTaskPool( /* private fields */ ); Expand description A newtype for a task pool for IO-intensive work (i.e. tasks that spend very little time in a “woken” state) See TaskPool documentation for details on Bevy tasks. Implementations § Source § impl IoTaskPool Source pub fn get_or_init (f: impl FnOnce () -> TaskPool ) -> &'static IoTaskPool Gets the global IoTaskPool instance, or initializes it with f . Source pub fn try_get () -> Option <&'static IoTaskPool > Attempts to get the global IoTaskPool instance, or returns None if it is not initialized. Source pub fn get () -> &'static IoTaskPool Gets the global IoTaskPool instance. § Panics Panics if the global instance has not been initialized yet. Methods from Deref <Target = TaskPool > § Source pub fn thread_num (&self) -> usize Return the number of threads owned by the task pool Source pub fn scope <'env, F, T>(&self, f: F) -> Vec <T> where F: for<'scope> FnOnce (&'scope Scope <'scope, 'env, T>), T: Send + 'static, Allows spawning non- 'static futures on the thread pool. The function takes a callback, passing a scope object into it. The scope object provided to the callback can be used to spawn tasks. This function will await the completion of all tasks before returning. This is similar to thread::scope and rayon::scope . § Example use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; let pool = TaskPool::new(); let mut x = 0 ; let results = pool.scope(|s| { s.spawn( async { // you can borrow the spawner inside a task and spawn tasks from within the task s.spawn( async { // borrow x and mutate it. x = 2 ; // return a value from the task 1 }); // return some other value from the first task 0 }); }); // The ordering of results is non-deterministic if you spawn from within tasks as above. // If you're doing this, you'll have to write your code to not depend on the ordering. assert! (results.contains( & 0 )); assert! (results.contains( & 1 )); // The ordering is deterministic if you only spawn directly from the closure function. let results = pool.scope(|s| { s.spawn( async { 0 }); s.spawn( async { 1 }); }); assert_eq! ( & results[..], & [ 0 , 1 ]); // You can access x after scope runs, since it was only temporarily borrowed in the scope. assert_eq! (x, 2 ); § Lifetimes The Scope object takes two lifetimes: 'scope and 'env . The 'scope lifetime represents the lifetime of the scope. That is the time during which the provided closure and tasks that are spawned into the scope are run. The 'env lifetime represents the lifetime of whatever is borrowed by the scope. Thus this lifetime must outlive 'scope . ⓘ use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; fn scope_escapes_closure() { let pool = TaskPool::new(); let foo = Box::new( 42 ); pool.scope(|scope| { std::thread::spawn( move || { // UB.

( * foo, 42 ); }); }); }); } ⓘ use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; fn cannot_borrow_from_closure() { let pool = TaskPool::new(); pool.scope(|scope| { let x = 1 ; let y = & x; scope.spawn( async move { assert_eq! ( * y, 1 ); }); }); } Source pub fn scope_with_executor <'env, F, T>( &self, tick_task_pool_executor: bool , external_executor: Option <& ThreadExecutor <'_>>, f: F, ) -> Vec <T> where F: for<'scope> FnOnce (&'scope Scope <'scope, 'env, T>), T: Send + 'static, This allows passing an external executor to spawn tasks on. When you pass an external executor Scope::spawn_on_scope spawns is then run on the thread that ThreadExecutor is being ticked on. If None is passed the scope will use a ThreadExecutor that is ticked on the current thread. When tick_task_pool_executor is set to true , the multithreaded task stealing executor is ticked on the scope thread. Disabling this can be useful when finishing the scope is latency sensitive.

azalea :: bevy_tasks Struct Task Copy item path Source pub struct Task<T>( /* private fields */ ); Expand description Wraps async_executor::Task , a spawned future. Tasks are also futures themselves and yield the output of the spawned future. When a task is dropped, its gets canceled and won’t be polled again. To cancel a task a bit more gracefully and wait until it stops running, use the Task::cancel() method. Tasks that panic get immediately canceled. Awaiting a canceled task also causes a panic. Implementations § Source § impl<T> Task <T> Source pub fn new (task: Task <T>) -> Task <T> ⓘ Creates a new task from a given async_executor::Task Source pub fn detach (self) Detaches the task to let it keep running in the background. See async_executor::Task::detach Source pub async fn cancel (self) -> Option <T> Cancels the task and waits for it to stop running. Returns the task’s output if it was completed just before it got canceled, or None if it didn’t complete. While it’s possible to simply drop the Task to cancel it, this is a cleaner way of canceling because it also waits for the task to stop running. See async_executor::Task::cancel Source pub fn is_finished (&self) -> bool Returns true if the current task is finished. Unlike poll, it doesn’t resolve the final value, it just checks if the task has finished. Note that in a multithreaded environment, this task can be finished immediately after calling this function.

azalea :: bevy_tasks Struct Task Pool Copy item path Source pub struct TaskPool { /* private fields */ } Expand description A thread pool for executing tasks. While futures usually need to be polled to be executed, Bevy tasks are being automatically driven by the pool on threads owned by the pool. The Task future only needs to be polled in order to receive the result. (For that purpose, it is often stored in a component or resource, see the async_compute example.) If the result is not required, one may also use Task::detach and the pool will still execute a task, even if it is dropped. Implementations § Source § impl TaskPool Source pub fn get_thread_executor () -> Arc < ThreadExecutor <'static>> Each thread should only create one ThreadExecutor , otherwise, there are good chances they will deadlock Source pub fn new () -> TaskPool Create a TaskPool with the default configuration. Source pub fn thread_num (&self) -> usize Return the number of threads owned by the task pool Source pub fn scope <'env, F, T>(&self, f: F) -> Vec <T> where F: for<'scope> FnOnce (&'scope Scope <'scope, 'env, T>), T: Send + 'static, Allows spawning non- 'static futures on the thread pool. The function takes a callback, passing a scope object into it. The scope object provided to the callback can be used to spawn tasks. This function will await the completion of all tasks before returning. This is similar to thread::scope and rayon::scope . § Example use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; let pool = TaskPool::new(); let mut x = 0 ; let results = pool.scope(|s| { s.spawn( async { // you can borrow the spawner inside a task and spawn tasks from within the task s.spawn( async { // borrow x and mutate it. x = 2 ; // return a value from the task 1 }); // return some other value from the first task 0 }); }); // The ordering of results is non-deterministic if you spawn from within tasks as above. // If you're doing this, you'll have to write your code to not depend on the ordering. assert! (results.contains( & 0 )); assert! (results.contains( & 1 )); // The ordering is deterministic if you only spawn directly from the closure function. let results = pool.scope(|s| { s.spawn( async { 0 }); s.spawn( async { 1 }); }); assert_eq! ( & results[..], & [ 0 , 1 ]); // You can access x after scope runs, since it was only temporarily borrowed in the scope. assert_eq! (x, 2 ); § Lifetimes The Scope object takes two lifetimes: 'scope and 'env . The 'scope lifetime represents the lifetime of the scope. That is the time during which the provided closure and tasks that are spawned into the scope are run. The 'env lifetime represents the lifetime of whatever is borrowed by the scope. Thus this lifetime must outlive 'scope . ⓘ use bevy_tasks::TaskPool; fn scope_escapes_closure() { let pool = TaskPool::new(); let foo = Box::new( 42 ); pool.scope(|scope| { std::thread::spawn( move || { // UB. This could spawn on the scope after `.scope` returns and the internal Scope is dropped. scope.spawn( async move { assert_eq!

When you pass an external executor Scope::spawn_on_scope spawns is then run on the thread that ThreadExecutor is being ticked on. If None is passed the scope will use a ThreadExecutor that is ticked on the current thread. When tick_task_pool_executor is set to true , the multithreaded task stealing executor is ticked on the scope thread. Disabling this can be useful when finishing the scope is latency sensitive. Pulling tasks from global executor can run tasks unrelated to the scope and delay when the scope returns. See Self::scope for more details in general about how scopes work.
