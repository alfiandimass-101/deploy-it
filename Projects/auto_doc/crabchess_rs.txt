Crate crabchess Copy item path Source Expand description Tools for analyzing chess positions and building chess software in Rust. crabchess is a 100% Rust Chess API with no unsafe code that enables you to build chess-related software tools. crabchess can import and export PGNs (Portable Game Notation) and FENs (Forsyth-Edwards Notation), determine the status of a game of chess, identify illegal move attempts, determine a game’s ECO opening, track players’ time remaining, and much more. crabchess works not only with standard chess but also random board configurations like Fischer random chess (Chess960). § Example Most of the core functionality is exposed through the ChessPosition struct, which represents a game of chess. The ChessPosition struct can be mutated and consulted as a game progresses. use crabchess::prelude:: * ; // Create board with default (Staunton) starting position. let mut position = ChessPosition::new(); // Apply moves in SAN format. position .apply_sans( "e4 e6 Nf3 g6 d4 Bg7 e5 Ne7 g4" .split( ' ' )) .unwrap(); // Or, use the `Move` enum. position .apply_move(Move::Castle { side: Side::Kingside, color: Color::Black, timer_update: None , }) .unwrap(); assert_eq!

(F3), piece_type: Type::Knight, piece_color: Color::White, final_square: sq! (G5), is_capture: false , timer_update: None , }) .unwrap(); Modules § board This module contains types representing a chessboard and its squares. openings This module allows you to create performant trees of chess openings nested by move. pgn Tools for importing and exporting to Portable Game Notation. pieces This module contains the basic types that make up a chess piece. positions This module houses the ChessPosition struct, which holds the state of a game of chess, including its move history, clock history, PGN fields, and status. prelude squares Tools for navigating and relating the squares on a chessboard. Macros § sq Create a square from its file and rank. sqs Create a vector of squares. test_ move Test a move on a ChessPosition without actually changing its state.

Implementations § Source § impl ChessPosition Source pub fn pseudolegally_navigable ( &self, square: Square , by_color: Color , ) -> Vec < Move > Moves by pieces of by_color which navigate to an empty square . Note that unlike ChessPosition::pseudolegal_threats , the by_color parameter refers to the color of the moving pieces. Source § impl ChessPosition Source pub fn pseudolegal_threats ( &self, square: Square , color: Color , ) -> impl Iterator <Item = Move > + '_ Get threats a piece of color is or would be under. Source § impl ChessPosition Source pub fn fischer () -> Result <Self> Create a Fischer random chess position. § Errors Returns an error if Fischer FEN bank file cannot be read or FEN import fails. Source pub fn new () -> Self Create a ChessPosition with the standard starting position. Source pub fn builder () -> PositionBuilder Create a PositionBuilder , which can be (fallibly) converted to a ChessPosition . Source pub const fn get (&self, square: Square ) -> & Option < Piece > Get a square’s contents from the board. Source pub fn set_timers (&mut self, allocated: u32 , increment: u32 ) -> Result < () , Err> Set timers if not already set. § Errors Returns an error if timers have already been set. Source pub fn is_timeout (&self) -> Option < PositionStatus > If a player has run out of time, return their Color , else None . Source pub fn to_hashing_position (&self) -> Self Clone ChessPosition without metadata, suitable for hashing. Source pub fn from_fen (fen: & str ) -> Result <Self, Err> Import a FEN into a ChessPosition . § Errors If the FEN is invalid, the function will return an error. Source pub fn fen (&self) -> String Get FEN string for position. Source pub fn apply_move (&mut self, m: Move ) -> Result < Legality , Err> Apply a Move to the board. § Errors Returns an error if the move’s legality cannot be determined or if the position is invalid. Source pub fn is_threatened (&self, square: Square , color: Color ) -> bool Return a bool representing whether or not a piece of color at square is or would be under threat. Source pub fn is_in_check (&self, color: Color ) -> bool Returns a bool representing whether color ’s king is in check. Source pub fn checks (&self, color: Color ) -> Option < Vec < Move >> Returns None if king is not in check, else its threats.

This method moves pieces on the board, alternates the turn, and updates en_passant_final_square , castling_rights , halfmove_clock , fullmove_clock and position_history . § Errors Returns an error if there is insufficient initial position data to determine how to make a castling move. Source pub fn opening (&self) -> Result < Option <& Opening >, Err> Get opening from default tree (see openings module). § Errors Returns an error if the position’s move history is None or invalid. Source pub fn sans (&self) -> Result < Vec < CompactString >, Err> Export moves in SAN notation. § Errors Returns an error if position does not have move history or initial FEN. Source pub fn is_stalemate (&self) -> bool Return a bool representing whether the position is stalemated.
